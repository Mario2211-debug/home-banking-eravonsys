# Homebanking API

Homebanking API allows for user registration, check movements, do mock deposits and do mock withdraws, accounts transfers and do mock service payments, and need subscribe to do international transations.

## Technologies

- Typescript
- [Hapi.dev](https://hapi.dev/)
- [JWT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)
- [Hapi JWT Auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hapi-auth-jwt2)
- [LowDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lowdb)

## Setup

1. `npm install`


2. Rename `.env-example` file to `.env` and replace the `JWT_SECRET_KEY` variable value with your own.


3. Create folder `database` in the project root (not repository root).


4. `npm run dev:tsc` for initial compile


5. Ready to be run locally at http://localhost:4000

## Scripts

`npm run dev` to compile and run the API in dev mode with hot reload on changes.

`npm run start` to run the current compile in production mode.

`npm run test` to run `api.test.ts` test file.

## Database

[Model used for the database](MODEL.md)

API data is saved using the file system and are human-readable `JSON` files.

Files will be located in a folder named `database` at the root of the back-end project.

Depending on the run environment a new file is used:

- `devDB.json` if in dev mode
- `testingDB.json` if in testing mode
- `prodDB.json` if in production mode

There's no model migration system.

## Endpoints

Request bodies must be in JSON format, response bodies are also in JSON format.

Endpoints that do not require authentication are marked with a `*`. The remaining endpoints check the
header `Authorization` for a valid JWT token that contains the user identifier. This token
is obtained through login.
